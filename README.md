# 🛠️ MicroProjects

Welcome to **MicroProjects**, a repository dedicated to microcontroller-based projects developed using the **STM32F401RE**. Each project is implemented using **Keil (CMSIS)**, located in the `Code` directory, and simulated using **Proteus**, available in the `Simulation` directory. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for embedded systems development, providing structured implementations of various functionalities.

## 📌 Features

- **Bare-metal programming** utilizing the CMSIS framework.

- **Simulation environment** established with Proteus.

- **Well-structured and documented codebase** to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

To access the projects, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MicroProjects.git
cd MicroProjects
```

### 2️⃣ Open and Compile the Project in Keil

- Locate and open the **`.uvprojx`** project file in **Keil**.

- Build and compile the project to generate the necessary binaries.

### 3️⃣ Simulate the Project in Proteus

- Open the corresponding **Proteus** project file (`.pdsprj`).

- Load the compiled **`.hex`** file from `Code/Objects/` into the microcontroller.

- Execute the simulation to observe system behavior.
